#006-Encrypted 1-to-1 chats  

From the fundamental decision about privacy, arises a new requirement: the private 1 to 1 communications, where users tend do disclose more personal information about themselves, have to be protected at all cost. The solution is implementing end to end encryption.  

The encryption is done on the front end side. The server never sees a private message as a plain text.   

The encryption keys are generated on the front end, then the private key is encrypted using a wrapping key derived from the password and stored in the database as an encrypted blob. A private key is never sent to the server as plain text.  

Finally, during registration and login, the password is also first hashed on the front end and only then sent to the backend. Where it is hashed again for normal security before being stored in the database. The hash we generate for authentication, although generated from the same plain password, is different from the wrapping key for the private encryption key. This way, the password itself is also never sent as plain text to the server, so the wrapping key cannot be derived from it.  

When a new user is registered, pair of public and private keys is generated and then encrypted using not only the current user’s password, but also all the recovery codes. The whole set of encrypted keys is stored in the database. If user forgets their password, they can later recover their keys using the recovery code at the same time as they recover the access to the account.  

If the password hash is changed manually in the database, it will not give the imposter the access to the private encryption key, and thus the messages will stay secure.
